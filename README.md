# graphics_engine

A graphics engine built with C++11 & qt5.

This is a personal project I'm doing for fun. It is in no way supposed to be of a
suitable quality for practical use. I was inspired to do this by a project in my
graphics class at SFU (CMPT 361).

The class had us build a graphics engine from the ground up, and I really enjoyed it,
but i rushed myself to meet deadlines, and saw a lot of things I could do better, or
expand upon.

So I decided to restart the project, and do it slowly and properly.

The project is (tentatively) being built like this:
